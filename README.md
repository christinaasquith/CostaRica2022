Practicing some JavaScript for fun 
In learning JavaScript, I've taken CodeAcademy tutorials, Hack Club workshops, Zell Liew newsletter, and now I'm doing the Girls Who Code workshops. Plus, I code w my Hack Club colleagues, and all together I'm figuring it out. 
This is a small project I'll be trying out from the GWC workshop.
